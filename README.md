This is a Flask-based web application for movie ticket booking and management. The application allows users to browse movies, view showtimes, and book tickets online. It provides a user-friendly interface for a seamless ticket booking experience.
Key features:

 - Browse and search for movies
 - View movie details, including synopsis, cast, and duration
 - Check available showtimes and seating arrangements
 - Select seats and book tickets
 - Manage user accounts and booking history

The frontend of the application is built using Jinja templates, which enables dynamic rendering of web pages with data from the backend. Jinja's template inheritance and filters are utilized to create reusable components and format data effectively.

The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. Flask handles routing, request processing, and database interactions. The application integrates with a database to store movie information, user details, and booking records.

This project demonstrates the usage of Flask and Jinja templates to create a functional and interactive movie ticket booking system. It showcases the implementation of common features such as user authentication, database management, and form handling.
